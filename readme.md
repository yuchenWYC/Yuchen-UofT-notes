## Yuchen-UofT-notes

This collection of notes aimed to help myself learn Math & Stats efficiently. Since one course gives dozens of theorems and corollaries, sorting them into clean notes was usually a good way to include them in the knowledge network in my mind.

**Update Nov 26 2023**: Two years after my graduation from UofT, I am still receiving appreciation towards these notes every month. Thanks everyone for your kind words! I'm glad these notes have been helping many of you through your own journeys at UofT ðŸ˜Š.
